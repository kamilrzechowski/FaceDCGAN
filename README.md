# FaceDCGAN
 DCGAN for faces generation. Tensorflow 2.0  
   
I would like tt thank the tensorflow team. Their sample code was very halpeful in creaing the project. https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan  

## Dataset  
The dataset used in the project is CelebA dataset of 200,000 images. The image size shul be (64,64,3). If you want to use different image sizes you will need to change network inputs to fit your requirements. The CelebA can be downloa from the webiste here: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html. The dataset should be uszip to the /img folder inside the project.
